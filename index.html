                        <p>Since 2008, I have been running a private practice in Glendora, providing compassionate support to adolescents aged 12 and older, adults, and older adults. From 2010 to 2014, I also served as an Adjunct Professor at The Chicago Schools of Professional Psychology. My practice offers a safe and understanding space where your thoughts are shared without judgment, your experiences are honored, and your growth is the priority. Whether you are navigating a difficult relationship, managing stress or anxiety, or seeking clarity and balance after a tragedy, I am here to support you in exploring your challenges, uncovering your strengths, and working toward the life you envision. Together, we will create a path forward that feels meaningful and achievable.</p>
